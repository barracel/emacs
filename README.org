* Barracel's Emacs Config

My current emacs configuration file depends on the fantastic
bbatsov's prelude https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude

** How to use it [fn:0]
Clone the repo an run =setup.sh=. It will take care of cloning prelude's repo
and creating a link.


** Why not a fork of bbatsov's

The recommended way of customizing prelude is by forking and adding your stuff
to the personal folder. However I prefer having a separate repo where I can link
to the desired revision of prelude. It's cleaner and it forces me to treat
prelude as an external dependency.


[fn:0] It has been only tested in ubuntu
