;;; Commentary:

;; Implements LRU (Least Recently Used) stacking for kill-ring.
;;
;; By default Emacs treats the kill-ring as a "ring", I find it more useful
;; to move each yanked item to the top of a stack instead.  This way
;; recently used (inserted) stuff are always at the top -- think alt-tab in
;; Windows.
;;
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;;   Put this file into your load-path and the following into your
;;   ~/.emacs:
;;
;;   (require 'LRU-yank)
;;   (setq LRU-yank-mode t)
;;
;;
;; Related packages:

;;  `buffer-stack'
;;  `bubble'
